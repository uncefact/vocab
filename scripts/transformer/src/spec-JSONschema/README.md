# UN/CEFACT JSON Schema NDR Technical Specification

Multiple groups within UN/CEFACT wish to develop standard Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) as part of the set of technical deliverables from their project. The RDM2API project demonstrated that it is possible to go from the semantics of UN/CEFACT towards APIs. This project aims to develop a technical specification in order to move from Reference Data Model (RDM) based deliverables to a standardized API which retains the richness of information available in RDMs. 

The JSON Schema NDR TS defines a standardised method to generate the UN/CEFACT data structures of the reference data models and their derived message structures as standardised JSON schema files. The https://github.com/uncefact/spec-JSONschema publishes the standardised JSON schema files as well as examples. 

This repository serves as a test platform during the project phase. Subsequently, the final location for the publication of the UN/CEFACT standards will be specified. The generated JSON schema files will serve as standardised input for the JSON-LD project from the end of this project. In this way, conformity between these two formats will be ensured. 

The [JSON Schema NDR Technical Specification 1.0](https://unece.org/trade/trade-facilitation-and-e-businessuncefact/json-schema-naming-and-design-rules) from the UN/CEFACT website can be found [here](https://unece.org/trade/trade-facilitation-and-e-businessuncefact/json-schema-naming-and-design-rules).


## Content

In this repository there are two main publications of UN/CEFACT JSON schema artefacts: 

* The first variant in the [JSONSchema2020-12](https://github.com/uncefact/spec-JSONschema/tree/main/JSONschema2020-12) folder is based on JSON schema draft 2020-12 and fully supports OpenAPI 3.1.x.

* The second variant in the [Compatibility](https://github.com/uncefact/spec-JSONschema/tree/main/compatibility) folder supports OpenAPI 3.0.x and therefore uses some older JSON schema concepts.

Use cases for extensions, restrictions and contextualisations of the publications can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/uncefact/spec-JSONschema/tree/main/examples) folder.
